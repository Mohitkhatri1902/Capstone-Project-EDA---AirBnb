# Capstone-Project-EDA---AirBnb.    
This is the Capstone project which is a part of my Data Science course at AlmaBetter.

***Problem Statement***

1. For this Project i am analyzing AirBnb's New York City data of 2019. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce.

2. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics that influence the listing of properties on the platform. For this we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis(EDA) techniques.

3. Data Analysis on thousands of listings provided through AirBnb is a crucial factor for the company.

4. We will be finding out the distribution of every AirBnb listing based on thier location, including thier price range, roon type, listing name, and other related factors.

***What Analysis I have Done.***

The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset provides a rich source of information about short-term rental listings in New York City. Through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), we have delved into this dataset to uncover valuable insights and trends that can inform business strategies for maximizing revenue and occupancy in the short-term rental market.

**Understanding Customer Preferences**

One of the primary objectives of the EDA was to understand customer preferences for rental properties. Location emerged as a critical factor influencing customer choices. Customers are willing to pay different prices based on the neighborhood or borough where a property is located. This finding underscores the importance of implementing dynamic pricing strategies that adjust rental rates according to the specific location, time of year, and local events. By tailoring pricing to these factors, property owners and hosts can maximize their revenue potential.

**Host Performance and Guest Satisfaction**

Identifying the busiest hosts and understanding why they excel is another key insight from the analysis. High-performing hosts play a significant role in maximizing occupancy and revenue. To encourage and reward hosts who maintain high turnover and occupancy rates, it's essential to implement host recognition and incentive programs. In addition, hosts should be encouraged to maintain high standards of service to receive positive reviews, which can attract more guests and lead to higher occupancy rates.

**Seasonal Trends and Marketing Opportunities**

The dataset revealed seasonal trends in the number of reviews, indicating that certain months or seasons experience higher review activity. This information can be leveraged for marketing and pricing strategies. For instance, promoting properties during peak seasons and tailoring pricing strategies for off-peak periods can optimize revenue and occupancy.

**Room Type Analysis**

The distribution of room types (e.g., private rooms, entire home/apartments) was explored to identify the most common room type. Understanding room type preferences is crucial for aligning the property portfolio with customer expectations. This insight can inform property acquisition and marketing strategies.

**Handling Outliers in Pricing**

The presence of outliers in the 'price' column was identified, suggesting that a few listings have significantly higher prices than the majority. These outliers can affect the overall distribution of prices and potentially influence customer choices. Detecting and addressing these outliers is essential for maintaining competitive pricing and optimizing revenue.

**Data-Driven Decision-Making**

The EDA project emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making. Regular EDA and analysis of the dataset are recommended to adapt pricing, marketing, and property management strategies to changing market conditions. Data should be the cornerstone of strategic planning and execution.

***Conclusion***

The Exploratory data analysis(EDA) of the AirBnb dataset has provided valuable insights and findings that can be used to make informed decisions for the short-term rental business. Here are the key Takeaways from the analysis:

**1. Location Matters:** The preferred price by customers varies significantly depending on the location. It;s essential to adjust pricing strategies based on the specific neighbourhod to maximize revenue.

**2. Host Performance:** Identifying and incentivizing the busiest hosts can lead to higher turnover and occupancy. Hosts who consistently provide excellent service and maintain high occupancy rates should be recognized and rewarded.

**3. Seasonal Trends:** The dataset reveals seasonal trends in the number of reviews, indicating that certain months or seasons experience higher review activity. Utilize this information for marketing and pricing startegies.

**4. Room Type Analysis:** Understanding the distribution of room types and the most common type is crucial for tailoring the property portfolio to meet customer prefernces.

**5. Outliers in Pricing:** Outliers in the 'price' column may affect the overall distribution of prices. It's important to identify and address these outliers to maintain competitive pricing.

**6. Data-Driven Decisions:** Data should be the cornerstone of decision-making. Regularly analyze and interpret data to adapt pricing, marketing, and property management strategies to evolving market conditions.

By action on these insights and recommendations, the business can optimize revenue, increase occupancy rates, and maintain a competitive edge in the short-term rental market. The EDA project has provided a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making and achieving the stated business objectives.

***Project Summary -***

In this project, conducted individually for specific reasons, I chose to work with a dataset related to Airbnb, a renowned online marketplace that facilitates property rentals for travelers seeking short-term accommodations. Airbnb has revolutionized the way people experience and share their spaces, connecting hosts with guests in a unique and personalized manner. Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has gained global recognition, making data analysis of its extensive listing information crucial for various purposes.

The dataset under consideration comprises approximately 49,000 observations with 16 columns encompassing both categorical and numerical values. This dataset offers valuable insights that can inform decision-making, enhance security measures, and provide a deeper understanding of host and guest behaviors and performance on the platform. Additionally, it can guide marketing strategies and the implementation of innovative services.

Key areas of exploration and analysis in this project include, but are not limited to:

**Hosts and Areas Analysis:** Investigating the characteristics of different hosts and areas, shedding light on what makes hosts and neighborhoods distinct.

**Predictive Insights:** Utilizing the dataset for predictions, which may encompass forecasting property locations, pricing trends, and review ratings, among other factors.

**Host Activity:** Identifying the busiest hosts and understanding the factors contributing to their high activity levels.

**Regional Disparities:** Exploring differences in traffic (e.g., booking frequency) among various areas and investigating the underlying reasons for these disparities.

This project aims to extract valuable information from the Airbnb dataset, contributing to a better understanding of the dynamics within the platform and the broader hospitality industry. The findings may be used for informed decision-making, strategic planning, and enhancing the Airbnb experience for both hosts and guests.
